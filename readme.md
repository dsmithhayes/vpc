## A virtual 16bit processor and hex memory editor.

This is a virtual cpu with 16kB memory. So far all it can do is read
and write files. I mean that's pretty cool but its not all that
impressive yet.

## Compiling

I am going to refactor this entire project to work with the Microsoft
C++ compiler - somehow. For right now, just compile all the .c files
together with `bcc` or `gcc` respectively.
