vpc
===

## A virtual 16bit processor and hex memory editor.

This is a virtual cpu with 16kB memory. So far all it can do is read
and write files. I mean that's pretty cool but its not all that
impressive yet.

## Compiling

### gcc

Testing this on many compilers. The follow is how to compile
and run `vpc`.

    $ gcc -o vpc *.c
    $ ./vpc

### bcc

This program works the exact same on 16bit DOS and compiles with BCC
flawlessly.

### Microsoft C++ Compiler

Maybe the Borland 32bit C++ Compiler will work instead? Some one
compile my project for it and test it.
